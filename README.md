RE:inventory is a simple mod to add some much needed quality of life features to Minecraft's inventory.
## Features (PLANNED)
**Sorting:** Instantly sort and consolidate your inventory or any container with a single buttonpress.

**Slot Locking:** Stop certain inventory slots from being sorted.

**Auto-Refill:** Automatically restock blocks and items when your stack runs out, even from Bundles and Shulker Boxes.

**Auto Tool Selection:** Automatically swap to the most effective tool when breaking a block.

**Quick Deposit / Loot:** Move all matching items between your inventory and containers.

**Improved Shulker Box UI:** Interact with your Shulker Box from your inventory, just like the bundle.
